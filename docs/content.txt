Lasts even without a carrier with a luscious chest. 70D or 70E, depending on weight. The shoulders aren't strained and I feel held. | mey® Customer review: Sits nicely as a strapless bra. Comfortable, forms a full, round breast, and doesn't show under clothing. I also have it in black, and they both run the same. | mey® Customer review: Nice, simple bra, ordered 2 different sizes, unfortunately not my fit. Nice, clear shop. | mey® Customer review: Nice shirt - but unfortunately the strap was sewn on twisted! Still waiting for the exchange! Have this shirt at least 4 times already! | mey® Customer review: The bra shirt is of good quality and very comfortable on the skin. It has a very good seat. I feel comfortable in this bra shirt.
